Introduction

The "Smart Driver Support and Accident Detection System" is a mobile app designed to improve road safety and emergency response, particularly in regions like Sri Lanka. It leverages real-time sensor data, machine learning, and GPS to detect accidents by monitoring vehicle dynamics such as velocity, direction, and impact forces. The system immediately alerts emergency contacts and authorities with precise incident details. 

It also offers advanced driver assistance features, including road sign recognition, brake light detection, and real-time alerts to reduce collisions and encourage safer driving. Flood prediction capabilities analyze weather and historical data to suggest safer routes during natural disasters. Additionally, a Driver Behavior Monitoring System (DBMS) detects unsafe practices like fatigue and distractions, enhancing driving habits and supporting autonomous vehicle research. This comprehensive platform integrates accident detection, driver assistance, and disaster readiness for a safer driving experience.
